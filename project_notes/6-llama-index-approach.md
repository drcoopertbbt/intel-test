Yes, LlamaIndex's advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines support hybrid search techniques, combining both keyword-based (sparse) and vector-based (dense) retrieval methods to enhance information retrieval accuracy.

Hybrid search leverages the strengths of both retrieval approaches:

- **Keyword-Based Search (Sparse Retrieval):** Utilizes traditional methods like BM25 to match exact terms in queries and documents, ensuring precision in retrieval.

- **Vector-Based Search (Dense Retrieval):** Employs embeddings to capture semantic meanings, allowing for the retrieval of contextually relevant information even when exact keywords aren't present.

By integrating these methods, hybrid search provides a more comprehensive retrieval mechanism, effectively handling diverse query types.

In LlamaIndex, implementing hybrid search involves:

1. **Setting Up a Vector Store:** Utilizing vector databases like Qdrant to store embeddings.

2. **Enabling Hybrid Search Parameters:** Configuring parameters such as `enable_hybrid=True` to activate hybrid search capabilities.

3. **Adjusting the Alpha Parameter:** Fine-tuning the `alpha` parameter to balance the influence between keyword and vector search, where `alpha=0.0` emphasizes keyword search and `alpha=1.0` emphasizes vector search.

For example, when using Qdrant as the vector store, enabling hybrid search can be achieved by setting `enable_hybrid=True` in the configuration. 

Fine-tuning the `alpha` parameter is crucial for optimizing retrieval performance, as it determines the weighting between sparse and dense retrieval methods. 

By incorporating hybrid search into RAG pipelines, LlamaIndex enhances the retrieval process, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
