Our architecture begins by capturing network traffic through a SPAN port, where Python scripts utilizing Protobuf handle serialization and transfer data into Kafka. From Kafka, data flows into two core environments: Materialize for real-time stream processing and HDF5 for structured historical storage. These environments are seamlessly integrated into the chatbot’s Python framework, allowing it to dynamically determine the most relevant source for a given query. This decision-making process is enhanced by the incorporation of the Semantic Router, a library supported by Arial AI, which introduces a language-driven framework for creating routes. By defining specific routes, the Semantic Router ensures the chatbot can intelligently decide whether to access real-time data from Materialize or historical data from HDF5 based on the context of the query.

The chatbot is powered by a fine-tuned Gemma 2B model, optimized through supervised training with NIST datasets and deployed efficiently via PyTorch with Intel’s oneDNN. To expand its capabilities, the architecture integrates LLAMA Index for sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. Using hybrid search techniques such as BM25 and cosine similarity, LLAMA Index enables precise and semantically rich search results. Its multi-step RAG pipelines interact dynamically with the NIST database, leveraging its structured metadata for enhanced navigability and contextual understanding. These capabilities ensure the chatbot delivers both real-time insights and comprehensive historical analysis.

Arize AI’s Phoenix project adds a critical layer of observability and interpretability to the system. By incorporating the "model as judge" paradigm, the architecture allows the chatbot to evaluate and interpret complex datasets within the NIST database context. This functionality, integrated seamlessly with LLAMA Index and agentic workflows, adds depth and nuance to the chatbot’s responses, uncovering insights that might otherwise be missed. Together, Arize AI and LLAMA enhance both the analytical rigor and operational reliability of the system.

For optimization, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning within the ONNX framework, and the fine-tuned model is renamed post-training. The architecture employs PyTorch and Intel’s oneAPI for inference, achieving significant performance gains over GGUF and LLAMA.cpp implementations. This optimization pipeline leverages Intel AICPU and oneAPI technologies for exceptional speed and accuracy while ensuring the model remains portable and compatible across environments.

An additional API service wraps the model, enabling secure interaction and facilitating the creation of an agentic workflow that connects a secondary agent operating in a public cloud environment. This cloud-based agent, managed by the same organization, provides access to more powerful computational and analytical tools. To secure communication between the local and cloud agents, a time-based security token system is implemented, ensuring robust security while maintaining operational alignment within the same domain. This architecture allows for scalable, secure collaboration between the agents, leveraging local and cloud-based resources for enhanced performance and flexibility.

By uniting Materialize, HDF5, the fine-tuned Gemma 2B model, LLAMA Index, Arize AI’s Phoenix, and the Semantic Router, this architecture achieves a sophisticated balance of real-time processing, historical depth, advanced hybrid search, and robust security. The integration of the API service and agentic workflows ensures seamless scalability and adaptability, delivering an intelligent and context-aware system capable of meeting diverse data-driven demands with precision and reliability.
